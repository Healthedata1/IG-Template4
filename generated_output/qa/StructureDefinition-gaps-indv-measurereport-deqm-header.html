<p>[MeasureReport] is used as an organizer for both data exchange for measure and for measure reporting.  Four profiles on the MeasureReport resource are defined in this guide to delineate these different uses.     The <strong>DEQM Gaps Individual MeasureReport Profile</strong> defined here based on the <strong>DEQM Individual MeasureReport Profile</strong>. It is used when a measure is reported to an aggregator for one specific patient. It contains all of the data that is relevant to generate the gaps in care report including the measure outcome and is similar to a QRDA Category 1 report. In addition, it also allows an evaluated resource to reference a specific measure population of the measure that is evaluated against.</p>
